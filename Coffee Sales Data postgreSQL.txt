Project Description:
In this project, I will apply my SQL skills to analyze the "coffee_data" database,
which contains information related to coffee sales, customers, and staff.
The project will cover data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and data joining, aligning with the syllabus you provided.

Apply SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
Gain practical experience in using SQL for real-world data analysis.
Develop an understanding of SQL data manipulation techniques.
Combine data from multiple tables using SQL joins.
